# journal
A CLI to quickly append journal entries into obsidian md

The program expects two environmental variables.
- JOURNAL_HOME: is the full path to the directory where your obsidian daily journals are kept.
- JOURNAL_FORMAT: is the date format used for the journal files (less the md extension).   (example: YYYY-MM-DD)
